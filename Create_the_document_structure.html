    <!-- page content goes here -->
    <p>If you want to write semantic markup – and believe us, you do want to write semantic markup – then you need to structure
        HTML documents properly. The html, head, and body elements have been part of the HTML specification since the mid
        1990s, and up until a few years ago they were the primary elements used to give structure to HTML documents. However,
        the situation has changed dramatically in the last few years as HTML5 has added a slew of new tags that can be used
        to add rich semantic meaning to the structure of an HTML document. Read more: https://html.com/document/#ixzz5FZGQYIMO</p>

    <h2>HTML Document Structure Before HTML5</h2>
    <p>If you’ve been using HTML for any time at all you know that every bit of HTML needs to be wrapped in html tags. An opening
        <!html>tag should appear first and a closing tag should appear at the bottom of the document. Every other bit of HTML should
        appear between those two tags. The head element is the first element to appear after the opening html tag. In the
        document head we place things like the page title and meta data, we add JavaScript to our page with the script tag,
        and we [link] to external stylesheets and other resources. On most webpages the head element is a very busy place.
        For this reason, we’ve created a tutorial that explains the tags that typically appear in the head element and what
        these tags are used for. All of the content that is visible on a web page is nested between opening and closing body
        tags. The body is the primary container of the content that makes up a web page. Up until HTML5, that was pretty
        much it for basic HTML document structure. All of our code was dropped in between the body tags and styled with CSS.
        However, now that HTML5 has broad support among modern browsers, it’s time to implement the new HTML5 tags that will
        give our HTML documents a much more meaningful structure. Read more: https://html.com/document/#ixzz5FZIN8juY</p>
